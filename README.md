# Data Science Internship Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! This repository is a compilation of projects completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project serves as a testament to my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and creative problem-solving. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the showcased projects:
Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.

Project: Customer Churn Prediction
Description: This project revolves around predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. It includes analyzing historical customer data, preprocessing, and building a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

Project: Spam SMS Detection
Description: In the Spam SMS Detection project, I built a system to identify spam SMS messages. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a machine learning model for accurate spam detection.

Project: Movie Genre Classification
Description: In this project, I developed a movie genre classification system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie genres.
